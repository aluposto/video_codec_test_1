 Fallback dependency on C++ extensions

This requires custom CUDA/C++ kernels and bitstream utilities for optimal performance. Without these, the system falls back to slower PyTorch implementations.

Training & dataset generalization

Trained primarily on standard datasets (like Vimeo-90K, UVG, HEVC test sequences). Real-world performance on unseen distributions (mobile captures, low-light, noise) may not match reported numbers.

Computational Complexity 

Still requires a relatively large GPU (A100). Running on consumer GPUs (RTX 30/40 series) is feasible but not benchmarked in detail.
