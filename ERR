LibMambaUnsatisfiableError: Encountered problems while solving:
  - nothing provides requested python-distutils
  - package build-0.10.0-py310h06a4308_0 requires python >=3.10,<3.11.0a0, but none of the providers can be installed

Could not solve for environment specs
The following packages are incompatible
├─ build is installable with the potential options
│  ├─ build 0.10.0 would require

│  ├─ build 0.10.0 would require

│  ├─ build 0.10.0 would require

│  └─ build 0.10.0 would require
│     └─ python >=3.9,<3.10.0a0 , which can be installed;
├─ pin-1 is not installable because it requires
│  └─ python 3.12.* , which conflicts with any installable versions previously reported;
└─ python-distutils does not exist (perhaps a typo or a missing channel).
