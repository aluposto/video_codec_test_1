Nice — you’re already in the right place. Below I’ll give a concise, copy-paste set of notebook cells and shell commands you can run from inside your Jupyter session (no sudo required) to build DCVC native extensions, run a quick test, and handle the most common failure modes. I’ll assume your kernel is already using the dcvc_rt_env conda env (if not, I also show exactly how to force running commands inside it).


---

1) Quick checks (run these first)

Paste into one notebook cell and run:

# confirm conda env and python
which python
python --version
python -c "import torch; print('torch', torch.__version__, 'cuda', torch.version.cuda)"
# check GPU drivers / cuda availability
python -c "import torch; print('cuda_available', torch.cuda.is_available(), 'n_gpus', torch.cuda.device_count())"

# (optional) check system CUDA and driver if nvcc is available
which nvcc || echo "nvcc not found (that's okay if using driver-only)"
nvidia-smi || echo "nvidia-smi not found or no GPU"

If these print sensible info (python pointing to .../envs/dcvc_rt_env/bin/python, torch imports, and cuda shows 12.6 or None), proceed.


---

2) Ensure build tools are in your conda env

If you haven't installed cmake, g++, and ninja into the environment, add them now (no sudo):

# Run inside your env — this runs conda in your current session; safe if env is active.
conda install -y -n dcvc_rt_env -c conda-forge cmake ninja gxx_linux-64

If your notebook process is already using dcvc_rt_env python, you can also run:

# make sure these binaries are visible to the current kernel session
which cmake || echo "cmake not on PATH"
cmake --version || true
which g++ || echo "g++ not on PATH"
g++ --version || true
which ninja || echo "ninja not on PATH"
ninja --version || true


---

3) Build the native extensions (repo root)

From the repository root (where setup.py is located), run:

# Option A: build in-place
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# If you prefer editable install:
pip install -v -e .

Notes:

Watch the output for compiler errors (missing headers, symbol errors). Copy the full traceback if something fails.

If the build completes, you should see compiled modules (e.g. _cuda_inference.*.so) somewhere under src/ or build/.



---

4) Run the test script (example)

After a successful build, run:

# adjust paths as needed
python test_video.py --input path/to/input.mp4 --output path/to/out.mp4 --model_path checkpoints/dcvc.pth.tar

If your notebook kernel is not the same env, run via conda run:

conda run -n dcvc_rt_env python test_video.py --input path/to/input.mp4 --output path/to/out.mp4 --model_path checkpoints/dcvc.pth.tar


---

5) If build fails — quick fallback stub (lets code run on CPU)

If python setup.py ... fails and you need to proceed for quick testing, add a tiny fallback that avoids the compiled extension import error.

Create or replace src/layers/cuda_inference.py with:

# src/layers/cuda_inference.py
try:
    # compiled extension (preferred)
    from ._cuda_inference import replicate_pad
except Exception:
    # fallback using PyTorch CPU implementation (slow but functional)
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    def replicate_pad(x, pad):
        return F.pad(x, pad, mode='replicate')

Then re-run the test script with the same command in step 4. This is only a CPU fallback — it's slower and may not produce identical performance, but it often lets you validate the rest of the pipeline.


---

6) Common errors & remedies (what to paste back to me if things still break)

If you hit errors, copy the full error output and paste it here. Useful errors include:

Compiler missing / not found: g++: command not found — fix by conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64 (we already included that).

Missing header (e.g., Python.h, cuda.h): will show which package is missing; often python-dev or cudatoolkit-dev is needed — for headers in conda env: conda install -c conda-forge python-dev (rare) or ensure CUDA toolkit headers are available for your CUDA version.

Torch header mismatch: errors mentioning ATen or caffe2 — usually caused by mismatch between the PyTorch version used to compile and runtime. Reinstall the same torch wheel in the env and rebuild.

CUDA/driver mismatch: if torch.cuda.is_available() is False but nvidia-smi exists, confirm your driver supports CUDA 12.6 or match PyTorch wheel to installed driver/CUDA. If needed, try CPU-only torch wheel.

Undefined symbols at import time of compiled .so: usually due to incompatible compiler or ABI — try using the same compilers in conda (we used gxx_linux-64) and rebuild.


If any of the above errors occur, paste the entire traceback into the chat and I’ll point to the exact fix and exact conda/pip command to run.


---

7) Quick verification after build

To confirm the compiled module loads:

python - <<'PY'
import importlib, pkgutil, sys
try:
    import src.layers.cuda_inference as ci
    print("Loaded cuda_inference:", ci)
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to import compiled module:", e)
# list compiled extensions in repo
import glob
print("Compiled artifacts:", glob.glob('**/_cuda_inference*.so', recursive=True))
PY


---

If you want, I can:

give a single exact sequence to run right now (conda install build tools → build → run) as one paste-ready block, or

if you prefer, run through likely build failure outputs and provide targeted fixes (I’ll need the exact traceback).


Which do you want me to paste next — the single paste-ready block to run now, or do you want to try the build and paste any error here for me to debug?
