Nice — that error is clear: setuptools is trying to import the stdlib distutils module, but your Python 3.12 environment doesn’t have it available. That’s common on newer Pythons because distutils was removed from the stdlib and you need to install a packaged version (or the appropriate conda package) into the env.

Quick fix (run these in your terminal while dcvc_rt_env is activated):

1. Install the distutils package + ensure setuptools/wheel/build tooling are present (use conda so no sudo needed):



conda activate dcvc_rt_env

# preferred: install python-distutils from conda-forge and common build tools
conda install -y -c conda-forge python-distutils setuptools pip wheel build

2. Upgrade pip/setuptools (safety):



python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

3. Retry your pip install . and capture the log:



# from src/cpp
python -m pip install . 2>&1 | tee ../../install_cpp.log

What to expect

After step (1) python -c "import distutils; print(distutils.__file__)" should succeed.

pip install . should now at least progress past the egg_info/metadata stage. If it fails later (compiler, missing CUDA headers, undefined symbols), the log will show those errors.


If it still fails, paste the last ~200 lines of ../../install_cpp.log here and I’ll diagnose the next error (likely a missing header, mismatched torch/tensorlib ABI, or CUDA include issue) and give the exact conda package or env variable to fix it.

If for some reason conda install python-distutils isn’t available on your platform, tell me and I’ll give an alternate micromamba or pip-based workaround.
