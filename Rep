Hereâ€™s a polished scope of improvement version for your slide:

Asymmetric codec design: Shift computational complexity to the encoder (PC GPU) while deploying a lightweight, quantized decoder on VST devices to reduce latency and hardware demands.

Perceptual & stereo-aware coding: Integrate saliency/foveation and cross-view redundancy to minimize decoding workload while preserving visual quality in gaming and VR applications.
