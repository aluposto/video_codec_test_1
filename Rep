Great — nice job. Now we’ll continue the step-by-step build. Below are the next commands to run in your terminal, one block at a time. I’ll assume you’re still in the repo root (the fresh clone) and that src/cpp/setup.py has been replaced.

Run these steps in order. If any step fails, copy the exact output (or the files/logs I ask for) and paste it here and I’ll debug.


---

Step 4 — Activate your conda env (must be Python 3.12)

Run:

conda activate dcvc_rt_env
python --version
which python

Expect Python 3.12.x and which python pointing into your conda env (path contains envs/dcvc_rt_env).

If conda is not found, tell me and I’ll give micromamba commands.


---

Step 5 — Install compilers & pybind11 (no sudo)

Make sure compilers & pybind11 are available inside the env:

conda install -y -c conda-forge cmake ninja gxx_linux-64 || true
conda install -y -c conda-forge pybind11 || python -m pip install pybind11 || true

# quick verification
cmake --version || true
g++ --version || true
python -c "import pybind11; print('pybind11', pybind11.__version__, 'include', pybind11.get_include())" || echo "pybind11 not importable in env"


---

Step 6 — Upgrade packaging toolchain

python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel build


---

Step 7 — Build & install the C++ extension (from src/cpp)

This will run pip install . from src/cpp and save the log to install_cpp_build.log in the repo root:

cd src/cpp
python -m pip install . 2>&1 | tee ../../install_cpp_build.log

When it finishes, show the last 80 lines:

tail -n 80 ../../install_cpp_build.log

If the install succeeds, run the quick import test below. If it fails, paste the last 200 lines of install_cpp_build.log here.


---

Step 8 — Quick import smoke test (run if build succeeded)

Run this in your terminal (same env):

python - <<'PY'
import importlib
try:
    m = importlib.import_module("MLCodec_extensions_cpp")
    print("OK: loaded MLCodec_extensions_cpp")
    print("Has RansEncoder:", hasattr(m, "RansEncoder"))
    print("Has RansDecoder:", hasattr(m, "RansDecoder"))
except Exception as e:
    print("Import failed:", e)
    raise
PY

What to paste here if anything goes wrong

1. If conda activate fails, paste the conda error.


2. If cmake/g++/pybind11 checks fail, paste their outputs.


3. If pip install . fails, paste the last 200 lines of the build log:



tail -n 200 install_cpp_build.log

4. Also paste:



which python
python --version
which pip
pip --version


---

When you’ve run Steps 4–7, paste the outputs (or the failure log). I’ll parse the compiler/linker output and give the exact fix — e.g., specific conda package to install, or a tiny edit to setup.py or the C++ compile flags.
