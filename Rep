Nice — your diagnostics show the src folder is in the current working directory (/home/work/dcvc/DCVC/src). That means PYTHONPATH=$PWD should allow a subprocess to import src.models. The earlier failures were caused by how the heredoc was run in notebook cells — let's do a simpler, foolproof test and then run training.

Please run these two notebook cells one at a time (copy-paste exactly). They avoid heredocs and are robust inside Jupyter.


---

Cell 1 — quick subprocess import test (one-liner, safe)

# Test whether a subprocess can import the repo's src package
!PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -c "import sys,os,inspect; print('Child PYTHONPATH=', os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH')); print('sys.path[0:5]=', sys.path[:5]); from src.models.video_model import DMC; print('Imported DMC OK, __init__ sig=', inspect.signature(DMC.__init__))"

If that prints Imported DMC OK... then subprocesses can import src and you can proceed to the training command below.

If it prints an ImportError/ModuleNotFoundError, copy the full output here.

Cell 2 — run training with PYTHONPATH set

# Run training ensuring the subprocess has the repo root on PYTHONPATH
!PYTHONPATH=$PWD python training.py \
  --train-glob "data/frames/train/**/*.png" \
  --val-glob "data/frames/val/**/*.png" \
  --patch-size 256 --temporal-len 4 --batch-size 6 \
  --epochs 30 --cuda --amp \
  --pretrained "./checkpoints/cvpr2025_video.pth.tar" \
  --lambda-rd 0.01 \
  --save-dir "./checkpoints_finetune_lambda0.01" \
  --log-dir "./logs/dcvc_finetune_lambda0.01" \
  --workers 4

If training fails again, do not worry — paste the full output (the traceback) here. Two likely next issues and how I’ll handle them immediately:

If you see ModuleNotFoundError again, paste the exact output and I’ll tell you the exact path to set in PYTHONPATH (but based on your last message it should work).

If it imports OK but fails later at model.update() / model.compress() due to missing compiled extensions (e.g., MLCodec_extensions_cpp, RANS encoder, or CUDA helpers), paste that traceback and I will:

provide a robust fallback training mode that skips entropy coding and optimizes only MSE (so you can still fine-tune decoder weights), or

patch the wrapper to call internal decoder modules (best-effort) to produce reconstructions without the C++ coder.



Run Cell 1 now and paste the result if it fails — otherwise run Cell 2 and paste any error output you get.
