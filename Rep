Thanks — let’s fix this now. You tried Option A and still get ModuleNotFoundError, which means Python still isn't finding the actual src directory where models live. I’ll give you (A) a quick diagnostics checklist (exact commands to run, copy/paste), and (B) a robust one-line patch you can add to train/debug_model_io.py so the script will always find src regardless of where you run it from. Do both so we’re certain.


---

A — Diagnostics (run these exact commands from your repo root /home/work/dcvc/DCVC)

Copy and paste each block and post the output if something looks wrong.

1. Confirm current working directory and list top-level files:



pwd
ls -la

Expected: pwd → /home/work/dcvc/DCVC (or wherever your repo root is). ls should show src/, train/, etc.

2. Show src location and contents:



# show src path if present
ls -la src || echo "no src dir at $PWD/src"

# list models folder
ls -la src/models || echo "no src/models dir -- check location"

3. Print Python import info (run inside same shell):



# show PYTHONPATH and python version
echo "PYTHONPATH='$PYTHONPATH'"
python -V
python -c "import sys; print('sys.path first 6 entries:', sys.path[:6])"

4. Try importing interactively and print module file path:



python - <<'PY'
import importlib, sys
try:
    m = importlib.import_module('src.models.image_model')
    print('Imported src.models.image_model from', getattr(m, '__file__', 'no __file__'))
except Exception as e:
    print('IMPORT ERROR:', repr(e))
    print('sys.path used:', sys.path[:10])
PY

If any step shows no src dir or no src/models dir, that is the root cause — your src is not where we expect. If import still fails, paste the full output here.


---

B — Robust quick patch (guaranteed to work if src is under the repo)

Open train/debug_model_io.py and replace the very top (first ~10 lines) with this exact block. This will automatically compute the repo root and insert the correct src path into sys.path no matter where you run the script from:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
# --- BEGIN AUTO-SRC-PATH PATCH ---
import os, sys
# Determine repository root relative to this script file (train/ is one level below repo root)
THIS_FILE = os.path.abspath(__file__)
TRAIN_DIR = os.path.dirname(THIS_FILE)
REPO_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(TRAIN_DIR, '..'))
# Candidate src paths (common variants)
candidates = [
    os.path.join(REPO_ROOT, 'src'),
    os.path.join(REPO_ROOT, 'DCVC', 'src'),   # in case repo has nested dir named DCVC
    os.path.join(REPO_ROOT, '..', 'src'),     # fallback: parent dir's src
]
found = False
for p in candidates:
    if os.path.isdir(p):
        if p not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, p)
        found = True
        break
if not found:
    # Fallback: search for a 'models' dir somewhere under repo root and add its parent as src
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(REPO_ROOT):
        if 'models' in dirs:
            candidate_src = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(root))
            if candidate_src not in sys.path:
                sys.path.insert(0, candidate_src)
            found = True
            break
if not found:
    print("WARNING: could not auto-locate 'src' under repo root:", REPO_ROOT)
    print("sys.path currently:", sys.path[:6])
# --- END AUTO-SRC-PATH PATCH ---

Make sure this block appears before any from src.models... imports. Save the file.

Then run:

python train/debug_model_io.py --clip data/train_videos/game_A_level1_clip01.mp4 --device cuda --frames 5

This patch will either succeed or print a WARNING with sys.path so you can see what it used.


---

C — If src/models exists but __init__.py is missing

Some setups require __init__.py to treat folders as packages. Ensure src/models/__init__.py exists:

ls -la src/models/__init__.py || touch src/models/__init__.py && echo "created src/models/__init__.py"

Then re-run the debug script.


---

D — If src truly lives somewhere else (unexpected layout)

If the diagnostics in A showed src isn't under /home/work/dcvc/DCVC, find it:

# search for a folder named 'models' (may take a few seconds)
find /home/work/dcvc -maxdepth 4 -type d -name models -print

If this prints a path like /home/work/dcvc/some_other_dir/src/models, tell me that path and I will give you the exact edit to the patch to insert that src path manually.


---

E — If model constructors require arguments (possible next error)

If after import you get an error like TypeError: __init__() missing required positional arguments, tell me the traceback. I will edit debug_model_io.py so models are instantiated with safe defaults (e.g., load config file or call a helper factory in the repo) — I can patch that for you.


---

What I need from you next (pick one and paste output)

1. Run the Diagnostics block A and paste the outputs of the commands (especially outputs from steps 1–4).
OR


2. Apply the AUTO-SRC-PATH PATCH (step B), run the debug script, and paste the script output — either it will run and print model keys (perfect), or print the WARNING: lines and sys.path which we will use to debug further.



Either way I’ll take the output you paste and give the next exact edit needed.
